Unfair Crypto is the quickest and simplest way to get started with algorithmic trading of crypto currencies (and derivatives). The public version currently supports the full functionality of Binance, and in the coming months all crypto exchanges that provide APIs will be added. Unfair Crypto requires a Mac and uses [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), Apple's new programming language. But you don't need to know Swift to get started using the platform! Unfair Crypto is designed for ease of use, safety and complete coverage functionality.

## Background

Unfair Advantage is a Scandinavian software development company that specialises in very challenging projects within fields such as drone and fintech, and Unfair Crypto was built by Unfair Advantage founder Gustaf Kugelberg for the [Skye Crypto fund](https://skyecrypto.com), a crypto arbitrage fund that he co-founded. The fund needed a reliable toolchain to facilitated fast iteration and minimise the time spent fixing bugs and the result is the UnfairCrypto platform, which is gradually being open-sourced. It is designed to be extremely easy to use and highly extensible, and now anyone can use it to implement their crypto trading ideas, build visualisation tools or any other crypto related Mac or iOS app they can imagine.

The first part of the platform to be released is the interface for obtaining data from and placing orders at Binance. Over time the entire toolchain will be open-sourced, and all major exchanges will be supported.

## Usage

Unfair Crypto covers the entire API of Binance, which in turn means that anything you can do in the web interface you can also do with Unfair Crypto -- from getting the latest quotes to placing complex interlinked orders.

### Examples

Places a simple limit order for 2500 Cardano's at a price of 0.00003750 BT/ADAC, and prints the order status

```swift

// Sets up your API key and secret
Binance.setup(id: "My API id", secret: "My API secret")

// Places a simple limit buy order for 1000 Cardanos's at a price of 0.00003750 BTC, and prints the order status
        func handleOrderResponse(response: BnResponse.Order.Full) {
            print("Orderstatus: \(response.status)")
        }

        Binance.rest
            .order
            .limit(symbol: .adabtc, side: .buy, timeInForce: .goodTillCancel, quantity: 1000, price: 0.00003750)
            .handled(by: handleOrderResponse)
```
